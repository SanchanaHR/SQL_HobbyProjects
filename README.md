# SQL_HobbyProjects
This repository has a set of SQL hobby projects that I am having fun with.

# 1. Analyze International Debt Statistics
The data set consists of International debt data from The World bank. The project is to import and clean data using SQL and further carryout data manipulation. 
Through analysis we answer various questions like: 

    * What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
    * Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
    * What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

# 2. Motorcycle part Sales
The dataset has sales data of a company that sells motorcycle parts.They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale.
The analysis is to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses.

# 3. Optimizing Online Sports Retail revenue

and correlation are used to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!

# 4. Video games sales data
The data consists of video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977.
The analysis is focussed at finding the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best
and to explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
